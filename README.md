Sample code from an Android PWA to measure distracted driving.

Some code from CrimsonHacks 2019 project "Drowsy Driver", to demonstrate simple repository commands for a friend.

Original project is an Android PWA desgined to read data from a 4-lead EEG headset and display alpha, theta, and delta brain waves in real time. By normalizing these inputs, we can show when the user is in a "distracted" state.
